# roman_numerals

An API and a web based application that converts numbers to roman numerals.

### Prerequisites

- install npm and node: <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm</a>

- install bunyan and nodemon

        $ npm i -g bunyan nodemon

### Usage

- cd into project root directory

        $ cd ./server && npm install && npm start

- open new terminal window.

- cd into project root directory

        $ cd ./client && npm install && npm start

- Screenshots of project are available in the screenshot folder

### Testing

- cd into project root directory

        $ cd ./server && npm test

# Original Technical Task

Create an API and a web based application that converts numbers to roman numerals.

### Technologies to use

- Node.js 8.x

- React

### Minimum Criteria

- Converts numbers 1 to 3999 to the equivalent value in roman numerals.

- Converts Roman Numerals "I" to “MMMCMXCIX” to the equivalent numeric value. In reverse

- Simple react based web interface that uses an API created by you.

- Readme file explaining how to run the application, explain your approach and list any improvements you would make.

### Ideally

- Use ES6 syntax.

### You can

- Use any NPM modules in your application except for the conversion of numbers and roman numerals.

- Be as creative as you like on the user interface, use any client libraries you want.

- Don't worry too much about optimising the client code (unless you want to), you can explain how you would do this in the Readme.

# Approach

Below you will find a combination of assumptions made, notes, intended client approach, and intended server approach.

### Assumptions

- The endpoints doe not need to be authenticated. (If they do a bearer token will be added to the headers and a 401 status code will be returned if token is invalid)

- The minimum criteria seems to be missing part of it's description. "In reverse ". I will ignore this until I get confirmation of what it is.

- Data transfer will be accomplished using a Rest API. (For example not via sockets or using other technologies such as graphQL)

- All numbers will be integers and not floats or any other data type.

- The data will not be stored on either the client or the server after request has been made.

- At any time only one integer or roman numeral will be passed in a request to the api.

- No specifications on browser support have been made so I will make the assumption to support the latest 2 versions of each browser.

- Initial value does not need to be passed back in response.

- API will only be consumed by this client.

- Supported devices not in specification. Going to assume a mobile first approach.

### Notes

- Create react app is used as a boilerplate to get going as fast as possible. It will handle pollyfills using browserlist and babel-env. If needed I would create a webpack config to build the client with hot reloading, code splitting, pollyfills etc.

- Examples of some webpack configs done in other projects: <a href="https://github.com/nialloc9/currying">https://github.com/nialloc9/currying</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nialloc9/reactReduxJestBoilerplate">https://github.com/nialloc9/reactReduxJestBoilerplate</a>

### Intended approach Client

- As the project will only have one view I will use local state and pass that down instead of using a data store such as redux. This would be overkill for something like this. I will split the logic and view into 2. A container and a view. While inheritance could be used here I will use object composition instead as react favors it.

- Validation will be custom and created using a pipeline function that will call each validation function and pass it's response to the next function and so on untill it has called each function. If the end result is a string then display that as the message. This ensures that each validation function can be used individually or in combination with others (in any order) while keeping the code clean, neat, and reusable.

### Intended approach Server

- I will add middleware to log all incoming requests.

- A model will be used for validating the incoming data.

- The transformer functions for manipulating the data will be abstracted into a utility file to keep code clean and make it easier to test.

- I will use enveloping to ensure all responses from the server follow the same data structure. { timestamp, data }. This allows such things a requestId and other data to be added to the object later without effecting the core data struture returned.

- I will add middleware to handle common security issues.

- Tests will be added for the transformers.

### Intended API endpoits

- GET /manipulate/roman-numeral/:value
- GET /manipulate/number/:value

### Improvements

- Testing can be increased to 100% coverage for both client and server.
- End to end testing can be integrated to test application from the viewpoint of the user.
- Recent conversions could be saved in local state and shown on the left as quick references. (This is outside the scope of this project but would be a nice future feature)
